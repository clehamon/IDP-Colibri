## Build & development

you probably need to install some stuff, like ruby and compass: https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular

then "npm install"

might be that you also need to "npm install -g grunt-cli" and "npm install -g bower"

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
